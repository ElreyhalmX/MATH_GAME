# MATH_GAME
for my programming class they sent us to make a very simple game in python so I decided to make a super simple one,something educational you have to solve the multiplication in the shortest time possible to have a better score.






   1- First we import the modules that we will use, assign the flag variable and say hi to the  players.

2- Then we create while loop and we assign the instructions that will pass while the flag variable is "si"

3- finally we add the conditionals and the processes that will occur while the conditions are met, also if the flag variable is 'no' we break the loop![code3_snap](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87812364/189799744-07dd17ed-28b8-45f3-aacb-95791fa5c8f5.png)
